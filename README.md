# R-packages
**Custom packages and functions for R**

These packages are created principally for use by my research group at the [USGS Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center](https://gcmrc.gov/), to facilitate common `R` tasks that I (and others) carry out with some regularity.  
  
__Current list of packages:__  
__plots__: Convenience functions for common plotting operations  
__bugR__: Functions for common ecological analyses of invertebrate data  
__foodbase__: Functions for reading and working with Foodbase data  

There is also a `TEST` package and some How-To code that explains how building and installing these packages from GitHub works.  

Note: The `accessR` package does some of the same things as `foodbase`, except for light trap instead of drift data. But it is clunky and now deprecated. It may not even work anymore for all I know, and will be taken down eventually once light trap data imports are enabled in the `foodbase` package.
