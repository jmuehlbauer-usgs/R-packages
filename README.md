# R-packages
**Custom packages and functions for R**

These packages are created principally for use by my research group at the [USGS Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/sbsc/gcmrc), to facilitate common `R` tasks that I (and others) carry out with some regularity.  
  
__Current list of packages:__  
__plots__: Convenience functions for common plotting operations  
__bugR__: Functions for common ecological analyses of invertebrate data  
__foodbase__: Functions for reading and working with Foodbase data  
__packload__: Function for more easily installing, updating, and loading packages.   
__trueAIC__: Function for comparing AICs from log-transformed response models vs. similar linear versions.   

The `packload` and `trueAIC` functions are currently only available as sourceable functions (not embedded in a package). `packload` checks if a package is currently installed on a machine. If not, it installs it (via CRAN or else jmuehlbauer-usgs/R-packages). It also has an updater function to update the packages if requested. Then it loads all packages fed to the function too. Sourceable functions can be accessed in R using the following code (replace FUNCTIONNAME with the name of the function of interest):
`source('https://github.com/jmuehlbauer-usgs/R-packages/blob/master/FUNCTIONNAME.r?raw=TRUE')`

There is also a `TEST` package and some How-To code that explains how building and installing these packages from GitHub works.  

Note: The `accessR` package does some of the same things as `foodbase`, except for light trap instead of drift data. But it is clunky and now deprecated. It may not even work anymore for all I know, and will be taken down eventually once light trap data imports are enabled in the `foodbase` package.
