# R-packages
**Custom packages and functions for R**

These packages are created principally for use by my research group and colleagues, specifically at the [USGS Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/sbsc/about/gcmrc), to facilitate common `R` tasks that we carry out with some regularity.  
  
__Current list of packages:__  
__plots__: Convenience functions for common plotting operations  
__bugR__: Functions for common ecological analyses of invertebrate data  
__foodbase__: Functions for reading and working with Foodbase data  
__GCgage__: Functions for downloading data from Grand Canyon area gages.   
__packload__: Function for more easily installing, updating, and loading packages.   
__trueAIC__: Function for comparing AICs from log-transformed response models vs. similar linear versions.   

The `trueAIC` function is currently only available as a sourceable function (not embedded in a package). The `packload` function is sourceable too but is also embedded within the `foodbase` package. Sourceable functions can be accessed in R using the following code (replace FUNCTIONNAME with the name of the function of interest):
`source('https://github.com/jmuehlbauer-usgs/R-packages/blob/master/FUNCTIONNAME.r?raw=TRUE')`

There is also some How-To code that explains how building and installing these packages from GitHub works.  

Improvements, additions, and suggestions are [welcomed](mailto:jdmuehlbauer@alaska.edu).
