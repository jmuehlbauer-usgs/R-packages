**Functions for Reading and Working with Foodbase Data**

This packages contains some functions for importing and working with data from the Foodbase database. Currently only implemented for Drift data, with support for other gear types hopefully coming soon!

__Current list of functions__  
readDB: Pulls exported data from the Foodbase database for use in R.  
sampspec: Pulls exported data from the Foodbase database for use in R, combines Sample, Specimen, and Species code data, and formats the data to facilitate analysis.  
sampstats: Runs some simple statistics on formatted data sets from the Foodbase database.  
ordmat: Takes data from sampspec and builds ordination-friendly matrices of counts, mean/median/SD sizes, or biomasses, by taxon and sample.
