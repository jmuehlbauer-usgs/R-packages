\title{Determine the cv of rows and columns in a dataset.}
\usage{
cv(Data)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{A matrix containing only numeric data.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the cv of the rows and columns.
}
\description{
Computes separate coefficients of variation (cv) for rows and columns in a dataset.
}
\details{
Coefficients of variation suggest how amenable your dataset is to ordination. In general, cv < 100 is desired. If it is substantially higher than this, and if there is some biological rationale for doing so, relativization \code{\link{rel}} or deleting rare species \code{\link{delRare}} may be useful next steps in data processing. See McCune and Grace (2002) for additional detail.

The matrix specified in \code{Data} must contain only numeric values (i.e., no rows or columns of factors, site or species names, etc.) Site and species names may be included as row and column names, however.
}
\examples{
## Compute cv on some simple data
cvord <- cv(ordmat)
