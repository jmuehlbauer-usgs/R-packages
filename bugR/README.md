**Functions for Common Ecological Analyses of Invertebrate Data**

This package contains functions for preparing, creating, and post-processing ordinations. It relies heavily on the package [vegan](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vegan).

__Current list of functions:__  
__NMS__: For running non-metric multidimensional scaling on matrices of data.  
__cv__: For computing the coefficients of variation of rows and columns in the data.  
__rel__: For relativizing the data.  
__delRare__: For deleting rare species from the dataset.  
__axisR2__: For computing the R^2 values of ordination axes.   
__ordRotate__: For rotating ordinations according to environmental variables.
