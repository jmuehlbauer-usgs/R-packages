**Functions for Common Ecological Analyses of Invertebrate Data**

This package contains functions for preparing, creating, and post-processing ordinations. It relies heavily on the package `vegan`.

__Current list of functions:__  
__NMS__: For running non-metric multidimensional scaling on matrices of data. 
__cv__: For computing the coefficients of variation of rows and columns in the data.  
__rel__: For relativizing the data.
__delRare__: For deleting rare species from the dataset.
__axisR2__: For computing the R^2 values of ordination axes. 
__ordRotate__: For rotating ordinations according to environmental variables.
